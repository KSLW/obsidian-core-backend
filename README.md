## 🧠 Overview

**Obsidian** is designed as a modular event and automation system that powers real-time features for creators, communities, and developers.

It’s split into two parts:

- **Core Backend** – Handles API routes, authentication, database access, and event scheduling  
- **Dashboard Frontend** – Provides a live management interface built in React, consuming the backend API in real time

Together, they form a foundation for an expandable community management or streamer automation toolkit.
